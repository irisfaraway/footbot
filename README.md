# footbot

A Slackbot for getting your fantasy football league results.

This is my first Node project, so of course I wanted to build something extremely useful.

## To run the bot

1. Go to https://your-slack-team-name.slack.com/services/new/bot and create a new bot.
2. Copy the API key and save it to your environment variables as `$FOOTBOT_SLACK_API_KEY`
3. Run `npm start`
